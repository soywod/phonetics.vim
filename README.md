## Introduction

Vim Phonetics is a vim plugin that gives you English phonetic transcriptions of focused words.
You can choose between British English and American English.
You can also listen to audio associated to transcriptions.

The phonetics (transcription and audio) comes from [Oxford Learner's Dictionnaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/).

## Prerequisites

 - A network retriever ([curl](https://curl.haxx.se/))
 - A media player ([mpv](https://mpv.io/))

Plug 'soywod/vim-phonetics'
```

## Usage

Put your cursor under a word, then:

You can also specify the desired accent:
